## Part 2: Grant Application Template

### Executive Summary
```
jSOL is a passive Solana liquid staking index that automatically 
diversifies across jitoSOL, mSOL, bSOL, and stSOL to optimize 
yield while reducing single-protocol risk.

Problem: Users want staking yield but face:
- Protocol selection complexity
- Concentration risk
- Manual rebalancing overhead

Solution: jSOL handles allocation, rebalancing, and yield 
optimization automatically. Users deposit SOL, receive jSOL, 
earn ~7% APY.
```

### Key Metrics to Highlight
- **Target APY**: 6.8-7.2%
- **Protocols Integrated**: 5 (Jito, Marinade, BlazeStake, Lido, Native)
- **Code Status**: Core architecture complete, 15+ Rust files
- **Audit Plan**: Sherlock ($30K budget allocated)
- **Timeline**: Mainnet Q2 2026

### Team Section
```
Jubilee Labs
- Previously launched jBTCi on Base (live, 92/100 audit score)
- Experience with Yearn V3 strategies
- Focus on passive, diversified crypto strategies
```

### Use of Funds
| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Security Audit | $30K | Sherlock/OtterSec audit |
| Development | $15K | Testing, integrations |
| Infrastructure | $5K | RPC, monitoring |
| Marketing | $5K | Launch campaign |
| **Total** | **$55K** | |

### Milestones
| Milestone | Deliverable | Timeline |
